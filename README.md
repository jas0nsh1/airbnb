LA Airbnb Analytics

A quick look at Los Angeles Airbnb listings after COVID. We forecast where the market might be headed and identify what makes a listing successful, using the 2022–2023 LA dataset outlined in the assignment brief.  ￼

What’s here
	•	Scope: Post-COVID LA listings, 2022.10–2023.9, focusing on future trends and success factors.  ￼
	•	Methods: Excel for cleaning and visuals, Python for modeling. Tried linear and polynomial regression, plus Random Forest and simple simulations. Slides summarize approach and results.  ￼
	•	Highlights: Prices climbed into mid-2023 before a small dip. Random Forest gave the best price predictions in our tests (lower MAE than linear or polynomial). We also note host signals that correlate with higher ratings and occupancy, like verification, responsiveness, and complete amenities.  ￼
